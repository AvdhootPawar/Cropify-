    'NHigh': """The N value is high, which may lead to excessive vegetative growth.
    <br/> Consider the following:

    <br/><br/> 1. <i>Use balanced hydroponic nutrients</i> – Ensure you're not overfeeding nitrogen. Opt for balanced formulations with lower nitrogen levels.

    <br/> 2. <i>Dilute nutrient solution</i> – Watering down your solution can reduce nitrogen levels while maintaining other essential nutrients.

    <br/> 3. <i>Monitor pH</i> – Maintaining the pH between 5.5 to 6.5 ensures better nutrient absorption.

    <br/> 4. <i>Switch to fruiting nutrients</i> – For plants like tomatoes and peppers, using nutrients with lower nitrogen and higher potassium supports fruit growth.""",

    'Nlow': """The N value is low.
    <br/> Consider these suggestions:

    <br/><br/> 1. <i>Use nitrogen-rich nutrients</i> – Select hydroponic fertilizers with higher nitrogen (N) content, particularly for leafy greens like lettuce or spinach.

    <br/> 2. <i>Supplement with liquid seaweed</i> – Liquid seaweed is rich in nitrogen and can be added to the nutrient solution.

    <br/> 3. <i>Check your system's pH</i> – Ensuring pH is in the correct range (5.5–6.5) enhances nitrogen uptake.

    <br/> 4. <i>Ensure proper aeration</i> – Good oxygen levels in water ensure plants can absorb nutrients more effectively.""",

    <br/> Consider the following:

    <br/><br/>1. <i>Avoid phosphorus-rich fertilizers</i> – Choose balanced nutrient formulations that don't have excess phosphorus (P).

    <br/> 2. <i>Water change</i> – If phosphorus levels are too high, consider doing a partial water change in your system.

    <br/> 3. <i>Reduce or stop manure-based supplements</i> – Manure-based supplements tend to be high in phosphorus.

    <br/> 4. Use a <i>balanced nutrient schedule</i> focusing on nitrogen and potassium without adding more phosphorus.""",

    'Plow': """The P value is low.
    <br/> Consider these suggestions:

    <br/><br/>1. <i>Use phosphorus-rich fertilizers</i> – Opt for a nutrient solution that has a higher phosphorus ratio (look for higher second numbers in NPK ratios, like 5-10-5).

    <br/> 2. <i>Add rock phosphate supplements</i> – Some hydroponic solutions allow the use of organic rock phosphate.

    <br/> 3. <i>Monitor pH</i> – Keep the pH level between 5.8 and 6.2 for optimal phosphorus uptake.

    <br/> 4. <i>Increase light exposure</i> – Phosphorus deficiencies are sometimes related to inadequate light levels, especially for fruiting plants like tomatoes.""",

    'KHigh': """The K value is high.
    <br/> Consider the following:

    <br/><br/>1. <i>Reduce potassium inputs</i> – Use a nutrient solution with a lower potassium (K) content, particularly during early growth stages.

    <br/> 2. <i>Change the nutrient solution</i> – If potassium levels remain too high, perform a partial water replacement with balanced nutrients.

    <br/> 3. <i>Check for signs of nutrient imbalance</i> – Excess potassium may lock out calcium and magnesium, so ensure you monitor and adjust the system for other deficiencies.""",

    <br/><br/>1. <i>Use potassium-rich nutrients</i> – Select a nutrient solution with higher potassium content, particularly for fruiting plants like tomatoes and peppers.
