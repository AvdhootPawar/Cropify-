# üåø Cropify: Benchmarking Crop Production Innovations and Trends

---

Cropify is a powerful, dual-mode agricultural recommendation system designed to provide intelligent guidance for **crop selection** and **nutrient management**. This project was **proudly sponsored by HYGREENS**, and developed in collaboration with them to seamlessly support both **conventional soil-based farming** and **modern hydroponic environments**, empowering farmers and researchers with data-driven insights.

## ‚ú® Core Functionalities

### 1. Crop Recommendation

Get precise suggestions for the most suitable crops based on real-time environmental and soil conditions:

* **Intelligent Prediction:** Uses a **machine learning model** (Random Forest, trained on a curated Kaggle dataset) to recommend crops.
* **Dynamic Inputs:** Considers **NPK values, pH, rainfall**, and integrates **live temperature & humidity data** fetched via the OpenWeather API.
* **Versatile Use:** Provides recommendations for both traditional and hydroponic setups.

### 2. Fertilizer Recommendation (Hydroponic)

Optimize nutrient levels specifically for your hydroponic systems:

* **Nutrient Gap Analysis:** Calculates the deviation between current and ideal NPK values for selected hydroponic crops.
* **Actionable Suggestions:** Delivers specific, **rule-based corrective nutrient suggestions** to fine-tune your solution.
* **Expert Data:** Leverages real-world optimal NPK data directly from **HYGREENS** to ensure accuracy.
* **Hydroponics-Tailored:** Recommendations are crafted exclusively for water-based, soil-less cultivation.

## üîë Key Features

* **Data-Driven ML Models:**
    * Robustly trained and evaluated across multiple classifiers, with **Random Forest** chosen for its high accuracy (**99.09%**).
    * Comparative analysis included Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression.
* **Real-Time Weather Integration:**
    * Fetches live temperature and humidity based on city input.
    * Enhances prediction relevance by incorporating current environmental conditions.
* **Hydroponic Hardware Demonstration:**
    * A working prototype using the **Nutrient Film Technique (NFT)** regulates nutrient flow.
    * Simulates real hydroponic setups, providing practical proof of concept for the software's recommendations.
